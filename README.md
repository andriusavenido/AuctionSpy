# AuctionSpy
A Spyfall inspired multiplayer chatroom web application

## Premise
Auction Spy is an engaging online chat-based game that combines the thrill of deduction with the excitement of auctions. Inspired by the popular tabletop game SpyFall, Auction Spy challenges players to identify the infiltrator among them.

In Auction Spy, players join a virtual auction where they discuss and bid on various items. However, one player is secretly a spy who has infiltrated the chat and is trying to blend in while gathering information. The spy's goal is to remain undetected and discover the auction item being discussed, while the other players, known as bidders, must work together to uncover who the spy is before time runs out.

During the game, bidders exchange messages about the auction item, using clues and subtle hints to help narrow down the list of suspects. The spy, on the other hand, must carefully navigate the conversation without giving away their identity. As the game progresses, bidders make accusations and vote on who they believe the spy is. If they identify the spy correctly, they win the round. If the spy manages to avoid detection until the end, the spy wins.

Auction Spy offers a unique blend of strategy, social interaction, and deduction, making it a thrilling experience for players who enjoy mystery and intrigue.
